	<div class="text">Julia Carolyn Child was an American chef, author and television personality. She is recognized for bringing French cuisine to the American public with her debut cookbook, Mastering the Art of French Cooking, and her subsequent television programs, the most notable of which was The French Chef, which premiered in 1963. Julia Child made cooking fun. She inspired millions to take to the kitchen and appreciate the pleasures of making and eating good food. In 1995, Julia had the foresight to establish The Julia Child Foundation for Gastronomy and the Culinary Arts to further her far-reaching impact as a teacher and mentor after her death. Since 2004, the Foundation, through grants made to other non-profit organizations and by presenting the Julia Child Award, continues Juliaâ€™s legacy, educating and encouraging others to live well through the joys of cooking, eating and drinking well.<div>
