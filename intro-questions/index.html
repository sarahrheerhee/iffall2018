			<li>My name is Sarah Rhee. I am a junior majoring in Communication Design and Environmenal Science.</li>
			<li>I took Interaction Design: Understanding Health and Wellbeing last year which first introduced me to the subject. I am taking this class because I. wanted to continue this learning in this area. </li>
			<li>I have very minimal experience in HTML/CSS/JS. I took a short class in highschool and I am currently taking an intro computer science class this fall.</li>
			<li>I hope to learn the basics of interaction design to provide as a good foundation in a possible career in the field.</li>
			<li>Designing for the screen has to account for a more personal and digital relationship with the viewer whereas designing for paper has limited ways of interaction with the viewer.</li>
			<li>www.netflix.com is a website I think exemplifies effective design because it has effectivly organized movie icons and limited text. </li>
			<li>www.google.com exemplifies effective communication with a large amount of white space around the search bar that would otherwise distract the user from searching.</li>
			<li>www.amazon.com works well overall because the navigation bars are clear and does not cause any confusion.</li>
