	<h1>Feedback for Claire</h1>
	<p>Design in correct mobile dimensions</p>
	<p>Remove CN logo in the second postcard</p>
	<p>Include names of characters who say the quote</p>
	<p>The text in first postcard could benefit from bring two lines. It's also too cloase to the left edge.</p>
	<p>This is a monor thing but there's a weird black border around the first two. </p>
	<p>Text becomes a little too small in the last postcard. But I think this will get resolved once you start working in the correct mobile dimension.</p>
	<p>For the fourth postcard, the text is too close to the left edge. </p>
	<p>For the fifth, the image of the unicorn is too close to the top edge. Maybe include more of the sky to serve as the top margin.</p>
	<p>Same with the last one. </p>
	<p>The first four does a good job of image cropping when transitioning to desktop and mobile.</p>
