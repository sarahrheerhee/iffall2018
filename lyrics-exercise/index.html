<p class="heading">[Chorus]</p>
<p>Blackbird singing in the dead of night</p>
<p>Take these broken wings and learn to fly</p>
<p>All your life</p>
<p>You were only waiting for this moment to arise</p>
<br>
<p class="heading">[Verse]</p>
<p>Black bird singing in the dead of night</p>
<p>Take these sunken eyes and learn to see</p>
<p>All your life</p>
<p>You were only waiting for this moment to be free</p>
<p>Blackbird fly, blackbird fly</p>
<p>Into the light of the dark black night</p>
<p>Blackbird fly, blackbird fly</p>
<p>Into the light of the dark black night</p>
<br>
<p class="heading">[Chorus]</p>
<p>Blackbird singing in the dead of night</p>
<p>Take these broken wings and learn to fly</p>
<p>All your life</p>
<p>You were only waiting for this moment to arise</p>
<p>You were only waiting for this moment to arise</p>
<p>You were only waiting for this moment to arise</p>
